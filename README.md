# NoProc


Project are created during hackathon in LPNU 4-5 May 2019.


It is an application, which gamify routine tasks for children. 
They can take these tasks (wash the dishes, make a bed, etc.) and after carrying them out, children get points, which they can change for 
promotional items in their parents (ice cream for example).


When a child adds a task in application, parents get a message from the Telegram bot, in which child name, task, deadline and points are 
given. When the child drags the task to Done, the parents also receive a notification.
